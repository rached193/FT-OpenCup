            <h1>FT Open Cup</h1>

            <p> The <a href="http://fellowtamers.com/" target="_blank">Fellow Tamers</a> club, working together with Temporium, is glad to announce the FT Open Cup, a competitive Temtem circuit that will take place during the Early Access phase! </p>
            
            <p> The circuit will be divided into eight tournaments (one tournament per month), each with 200 euros in prizes. </p>
            
            <p> The tournament will lead to the FT INVITATIONAL, a closed tournament with 16 players and a 1000â‚¬ prize pool. </p>
            
            <p> Only the 12 players with more circuit points (granted by how well you do in the Minor Cups or the Qualifiers) plus 4 players from the Qualifiers will be able to join the FT Invitational. </p>
            
            <p> The winner and runner up of each Qualifier will join the tournament too. </p>
                
            <p> Each tournament is independent from the others, so you have to register for all tournaments you're interested once they're published. </p>
            
            <p> You can also join a single tournament and don't show up for the next ones. </p>
            
            <p> We will announce each tournament with a delay of at least 15 days so that each player can plan ahead properly. </p>
            
            <p> We really want to thanks Perdigano for making this tournament possible. </p>
