        "The Fellow Tamers club, working together with Temporium, is glad to host the first FT Open Cup, a competitive Temtem circuit that will take place during the Temtem Early Access phase!",
        "The circuit will be divided into 8 open tournaments (one per month), with at least 200€ in prizes.",
        "Each tournament is independent from the others, so you only need to register and play on the tournaments youre interested once they're published.",
        "Each tournament will be announced in the Temporium Discord with a delay of at least 15 days, allowing each player to planificate their entrance properly.",
        "The circuit will lead to the FT INVITATIONAL, a closed tournament with 16 players and  a +1000€ prize pool.",
        "Only the 12 players who gather the biggest ammount of Circuit Points (granted by how well players do in the circuit's tournaments) plus the winners and runner up of each Qualifier will be able to join the FT INVITATIONAL."
